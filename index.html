                <p> Hi, my name is Tom. I grew up in Lexington, VA and currently live in Fairfax, VA with my
                    girlfriend,
                    Liz. I went to college at UVA and graduated in May 2015 with a degree in civil engineering. I
                    worked
                    for two years as a civil engineer before deciding to change careers and pursue software
                    engineering.
                    I enrolled at George Mason University in the Applied Computer Science program and completed one
                    semester
                    before deciding that the pace was too slow and looked for alternatives. I found the George
                    Washington
                    University Coding Bootcamp and signed up as soon as possible. I am excited to learn cutting edge,
                    job
                    ready skills and be back in the work force so quickly.
                </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> Outside of coding, my two main hobbies are playing guitar and lifting weights. My mother owns a
                    music
                    store and my whole family plays music. I play mostly electric guitar and try to play as much as I
                    can.
                    I am also a National Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Personal Trainer and can squat 500+ lbs,
                    deadlift
                    600+ lbs conventional, and bench press 300 lbs. </p>
